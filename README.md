# sqlalchemy_hawaii_vacation
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

For this project, I did a climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii!. I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, I also used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Once I completed my initial analysis, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed. To do so, I used Flask to create the routes and return JSON files for the corresponding data.
